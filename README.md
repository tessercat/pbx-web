This repo contains
a Django project
that acts as
a configuration server for
the FreeSWITCH binaries
and base configuration in the
[pbx-amd64](https://github.com/tessercat/pbx-amd64)
repo.

The `fsapi` app
receives HTTP configuration requests from FreeSWITCH,
selects app-specific request handlers,
and returns XML config documents
generated by the request handlers.

The `channels` app
serves
and provides the back end
for the
[pbx-client](https://github.com/tessercat/pbx-client)
WebRTC peer.
FreeSWITCH's `mod_verto`
provides the peer discovery
and signal channel layer.
