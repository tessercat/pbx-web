# What is this thing?

It's a person-to-person
voice and video
web chat service.

Use this service at your own risk,
with no warranty of any kind,
express or implied.

Everything is on GitHub,
though it's not open source.
The
[pbx-docs](https://github.com/tessercat/pbx-docs "PBX docs on GitHub")
repo
is a good place to start.


# Troubleshooting

Your device must have
both a camera and a microphone
installed and enabled.
Make sure the browser
has permission to use them.

Check volume levels.

Poor wireless is often the cause of poor quality calls.

Connections fail when 
[ICE](https://webrtc.org/getting-started/peer-connections#ice_candidates "ICE candidates")
fails.
Use a VPN
when connecting
from restrictive networks.

Otherwise,
the service should work between
Firefox and Chromium-based browsers
on Android, Windows and Linux.
It hasn't been tested on appleOS.
