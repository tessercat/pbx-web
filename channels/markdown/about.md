# What is this thing?

It's a person-to-person
voice and video
web chat service.

The service
is organized by channel.
Channel members
see ID and status
of other members
and can request
a peer-to-peer voice and video call
with any other available member.

The service
is free to use,
and it's fairly private.
The call server
hosts the web client
and relays member status
and call-control messages
between peers.
Once calls are established,
voice and video
are "end-to-end encrypted"
and stream directly between peers.

Use this service at your own risk,
with no warranty of any kind,
express or implied.

Everything is on GitHub,
though it's not open source.
The
[pbx-docs](https://github.com/tessercat/pbx-docs "PBX docs on GitHub")
repo
is a good place to start.


# Troubleshooting

Your device must have
both a camera and a microphone
installed and enabled.
Make sure the browser
has permission to use them.

Check volume levels.

Poor wireless is often the cause of poor quality calls.

Connections fail
when a peer requires
[TURN](https://webrtc.org/getting-started/turn-server "TURN server").

Otherwise,
the service should work between
Firefox and Chrome-based browsers
on Android, Windows and Linux.
It hasn't been tested on Apple products.
